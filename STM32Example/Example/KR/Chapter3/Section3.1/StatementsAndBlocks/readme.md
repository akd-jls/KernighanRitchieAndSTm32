@par Example Description

	This project demonstrates the use of 'Statements and Blocks' in C programming language.
	We don't have example code here. But this a very fundamental topic of C. Any c program
	is based on this concepts.

	

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F401xEx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F4xx-Nucleo RevB 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@par Description from “The C Programming Language” 

	An expression such as x = 0 or i++ or printf(...) becomes a statement when it is followed
	by a semicolon, as in

		x = 0;
		i++;
		printf(...);
	
	In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it is in languages like
	Pascal.
	
	Braces { and } are used to group declarations and statements together into a compound
	statement, or block, so that they are syntactically equivalent to a single statement. The braces
	that surround the statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around multiple
	statements after an if, else, while, or for are another. (Variables can be declared inside any
	block; we will talk about this in Chapter 4.) There is no semicolon after the right brace that
	ends a block.
